# Express Middleware
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named `next`.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
1. Execute any code.
2. Make changes to the request and the response objects.
3. End the request-response cycle.
4. Call the next middleware function in the stack.

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

## Why Middleware?
Middleware is appropriate (and convenient) whenever there is work to be done before a request reaches your controller code, or to abstract out logic and know it will always "just happen".  Once your middleware has been coded and tested, it becomes a silent unobtrusive worker just doing its job and staying out of your way.

## Common Uses
### Logging
Because you can cause the middleware to be triggered for every request, it is the perfect place to perform your logging (Winston, Morgan, etc).

### Error handling
Every application is slightly different in how it should handle errors.  You may want to implement an error handler middleware to catch any application errors at a central location.  **NOTE** : Error middlewares are distinguished by taking 4 parameters instead of the standard 3. `(err, req, res, next)`

### Authorization
Your application probably needs authentication and authorization, right?  If you have a custom internal auth provider you might need to implement a custom authorizer middleware.  However, if you're using an existing third party auth provider, a middleware probably already exists for it.  See [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) for examples.

### Request Manipulation
There may be times when you need to manipulate a request before it reaches your controller code.  If so, a middleware is just the place to do it.

## Defining Middleware
Regular (non-error) middleware have three parameters and the following definition :
```javascript
(req, res, next) => {
    // Do whatever we need to do, including working with request and response
    
    // Call next() to indicate the end of our middleware and trigger the next one
    next();
  };
```

Error handling middleware has a distinct four parameter definition to uniquely identify them and to provide the error to your code.  Even if you don't need to use `next()`, you need to include the parameter to maintain the definition.

```javascript
(err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('An error occurred');
};
```

## Configuration and Priority
We previously saw that middlewares can be added to Express by calling `app.use(myModule)` though I didn't point out that this is what we were actually doing.  You can add middlewares this way and they will be invoked in the order they are added.  But, if you have a lot of middlewares and might need to vary them based on environment, you can define them in your `config.json`.  

Additionally, you can configure the `priority` property that will determine middleware order of execution if desired.  It's usually a good idea to space these out so you can add future middleware in between existing ones if needed.

If you're referencing a third party middleware module you can simply use the module name in the `name` property.  However, if you're developing custom middleware that is not included as a dependency you need to reference its file location with `path:directory/file` in the `name` property.

```json
{
  "middleware": {
    "errorHandler": {
      "enabled": true,
      "priority": 1,
      "router": "/",
      "module": {
        "name": "path:middleware/errorHandler"
      }
    },
    "checker": {
      "enabled": true,
      "priority": 10,
      "router": "/widgets",
      "module": {
        "name": "path:middleware/checker"
      },
      "json-body-parser": {
        "enabled": true,
        "priority": 20,
        "module": {
          "name": "body-parser",
          "method": "json"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
