    This is the core element used by impress.js: the wrapper for your presentation steps. 
    In this element all the impress.js magic happens.
    
    data-transition-duration sets the time in microseconds that is used for the
    animation when transtitioning between slides.
    
    The width, height, scale and perspective options define a target screen size that you should
    design your CSS against. impress.js will automatically scale all content to different screen
    sizes. See DOCUMENTATION.md for details. Below, I have targeted full HD screen resolution.
    
    data-autoplay can be used to set the time in seconds, after which presentation
    automatically moves to next slide. It can also be set individually for each
    slide, but here we just set a common duration for all slides.

<div id="impress"
    data-transition-duration="1000"

    data-width="1920"

    data-perspective="1000"

    <!--
        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.
        
        The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
        If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.
        This step is auto-assigned the id "step-1". You can also use `#step-1` in a link, to 
        point directly to this particular step.
        
        Positioning information is passed through data-* attributes.
        
        In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
        and `data-y="-1500"` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
        will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'. It will not 
        be rotated or scaled.
        
        The "step" class is what *must* be used for every "slide". In this example we also use the "slide"
        class, which adds a rectangle with some background and makes this presentation look like a traditional
        powerpoint slide show. The "slide" class is entirely optional and indeed you wouldn't use it for
        your cooler impress.js presentations.

    <div id="basics" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1>The Basics</h1>
        <p>HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) is a client-server protocol that is used to fetch resources over the internet. Requests are made by a client, to a server, and the server responds accordingly. The most ubiquitous example is a web page </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Client (browser) requests a web page from a server.</li>
            <li>Server accepts the request and transfers the page data (the response) to the client</li>
            <li>Client loads the page data and displays it to the user</li>
        </ol>

    <div id="stateless" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1>Stateless</h1>
        <p>HTTP is inherently a stateless protocol in that the server simply responds to requests from the client without storing state information about the client. Each request can be made in isolation and is not dependent on previous interactions. </p>

        <br />
        <p>That said, we've built a lot of stateful things on top of HTTP, like cookies and sessions, but it is truly stateless at the core.</p>

    <div id="tcp" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</h1>
        <p>HTTP is built on top of TCP. We won't talk much about TCP since it lives at a different layer and is abstracted away for us, but you should know it's there. The general flow of a HTTP request, with a nod to TCP, is as follows :</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Client opens a TCP connection to the server</li>
            <li>Client sends an HTTP request over the TCP connection to the server</li>
            <li>Server responds to the request with an HTTP response.</li>
            <li>Client consumes the response</li>
            <li>Client closes or reuses the TCP connection.</li>

        <h1>HTTP Requests</h1>
        <p>HTTP requests have the following components that we will shortly discuss :</p>

        <ul>
            <li>An HTTP Method</li>
            <li>The URL for the requested resource</li>
            <li>The HTTP protocol version</li>

        <h1>HTTP Responses</h1>
        <p>HTTP responses have the following components :</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The HTTP protocol version</li>
            <li>A status code</li>
            <li>A status message</li>

    <div id="methods" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1>HTTP Methods (verbs)</h1>
        <p>HTTP request methods indicate the action the request is expected to perform. For this reason, they are often called "verbs" since they dictate an action to take. We'll just discuss the methods used in a RESTful API and ignore the others for now.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>GET - Retrieve data</li>
            <li>POST - Submit data, usually to create a new entry</li>
            <li>PUT - Update data, replace an existing entry with new data</li>
            <li>DELETE - Delete data</li>
            <li>PATCH - Update data, but only a partial modification rather than the full replace of a PUT</li>

    <div id="status-codes" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1>HTTP Status Codes</h1>
        <p>HTTP Response status codes are simple numbers that indicate the state of the response.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>The Good : 200s</li>
            <li>The Wandering : 300s</li>
            <li>The Bad : 400s</li>
            <li>The Ugly : 500s</li>

    <div id="headers" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1>HTTP Headers</h1>
        <p>Headers are extra informational fields that are added to HTTP communications - both from the client and server side.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>content-type</li>
            <li>content-length</li>
            <li>user-agent</li>
            <li>authorization</li>

    <div id="ports" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1>Ports</h1>
        <p>While the TCP ports used for HTTP connections can be arbitrary, the default for HTTP is 80 and the default for HTTPS is 443. In your web service development you can choose pretty much any port (that isn't already in use) so long as you direct your requests to that port.</p>

        <br />
        <p>Network devices (load balancers, gateways, proxies, etc) and system port limitations complicate this a bit.</p>

    <!-- This last, empty "slide" is set to be very large using the data-scale attribute, 
         so that it covers all the other slides you just saw. 
         It's a common way of zooming out at the end, to show the whole presentation.
         In CSS, we set pointer-events:none to make this slide non-clickable. 
         It makes a difference at least for SVG content, such as the mermaid diagram. -->
