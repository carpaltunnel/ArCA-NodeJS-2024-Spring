# Lab #6
Expanding on Lab #5 (TO-DO list from file system), create a ToDo class/module that handles all of the file system interactions.  Your main script should accept the arguments then invoke the appropriate ToDo module functions to perform the necessary work.

All of the logic and requirements from Lab #5 still applies, we're just going to separate the list specific file system logic out into its own module.
