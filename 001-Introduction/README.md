## Terminology Clarifications
You will often see the terms Node.js, Javascript, and ES6 used interchangeably and I'm sure you will hear me do that even though it's not 100% accurate.  To be specific, this is what each term means in the most accurate definition.
1. Javascript - Javascript is a programming language.  With no other qualifications, this term covers all versions of Javascript, executed in any engine, or potentially not executed at all.
2. Node.js - Node.js is a Javascript interpreter using the V8 engine to execute.  The version of Javascript executed is not explicitly defined and you could mix a variety of them in one script without errors (but you should never do this).
3. ES6 - ES6 (or ECMAScript 2015) is the latest Javascript language definition and is the second major revision to Javascript.  It fixes many of the oddities and problems that were found in previous versions.  You should always write ES6 compliant code.

You'll also often hear or see "Node.js" shortened to "Node".  These are interchangeable for our purposes and "Node" is simply used to avoid saying "dot jay ess" over and over.
